ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m Rithik

ðŸ§  Problem-Solver | âœ¨ Innovator | ðŸŽ¯ Strategist

I build ideas into reality â€” mixing Ruby on Rails magic, AWS cloud power, and smart API integrations to create systems that actually talk to each other (yes, even devices with their own quirky personalities).

ðŸ›  What I Do Best

Ruby on Rails Development â€” Crafting clean, maintainable backends that scale.

AWS Services â€” Deploying, optimizing, and automating with EC2, S3, Lambda, and friends.

API Engineering â€” Designing, integrating, and securing endpoints that connect the dots.

Device Communication â€” Making hardware and software hold hands via MQTT, WebSockets, and other protocols.

ðŸ’¡ I believe every piece of software should be like a well-trained assistant: reliable, efficient, and never throwing a tantrum.
