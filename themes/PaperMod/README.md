👋 Hey, I’m Rithik

I build ideas into reality — mixing Ruby on Rails magic, AWS cloud power, and smart API integrations to create systems that actually talk to each other (yes, even devices with their own quirky personalities).

🛠 What I Do Best

Ruby on Rails Development — Crafting clean, maintainable backends that scale.

AWS Services — Deploying, optimizing, and automating with EC2, S3, Lambda, and friends.

API Engineering — Designing, integrating, and securing endpoints that connect the dots.

Device Communication — Making hardware and software hold hands via MQTT, WebSockets, and other protocols.

💡 I believe every piece of software should be like a well-trained assistant: reliable, efficient, and never throwing a tantrum.
